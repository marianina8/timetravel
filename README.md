# Timetravel CLI ðŸš—âš¡

Welcome to the `timetravel` CLI! Ever wanted to dial back the clock and revisit moments in history? Or perhaps shoot forward into the future? Inspired by the classic "Back to the Future" films, `timetravel` allows you to (figuratively) hop into your DeLorean, punch in a date and time, and embark on a fantastic voyage through the temporal realm! (1.21 gigawatts not required.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run the `timetravel` CLI, you will need:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.17 or later)

### Building the CLI

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marianina8/timetravel.git
```

2. Build the CLI:
   * For MacOS and Linux:
```bash
go build -o timetravel
```

### Feedback Survey
